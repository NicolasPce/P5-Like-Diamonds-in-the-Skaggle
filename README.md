# P5-Like-Diamonds-in-the-Skaggle

### Objective: 
The objective of the is to find the best prediction for the price of diamonds given a data set with their features.
And then submit in Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/diamonds-datamad1021-rev/overview


### Content: 
You will find in this repo the Jupyter Notebook that contains de cleaning of the data set and the test of the differents regressions.
And also de PPT for the presentation.
 
 
### Methods
